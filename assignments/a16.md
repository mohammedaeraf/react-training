# üìù Assignment: Implement CRUD Operations for **Customer Resource**

We will use [mockapi.io](https://mockapi.io) as the backend API to manage `customers`.

### 1. **Customer Resource Structure**

Each customer will have the following fields:

```ts
{
  id: number,
  name: string,
  email: string,
  age: number
}
```

---

### 2. **Steps to Follow**

#### (a) Create a Mock API

1. Go to [mockapi.io](https://mockapi.io) and create a new project.
2. Define a resource named **customers** with fields:

   * `id` (auto-generated by mockapi)
   * `name` (string)
   * `email` (string)
   * `age` (number)

This will give you endpoints like:

* `GET    https://<mockapi-url>/customers`
* `POST   https://<mockapi-url>/customers`
* `PUT    https://<mockapi-url>/customers/:id`
* `DELETE https://<mockapi-url>/customers/:id`

---

#### (b) Setup React App

1. Create a `CustomerList.tsx` to display all customers.
2. Create a `CustomerForm.tsx` to add/edit customers.
3. Use React Router (`react-router-dom`) for navigation:

   * `/customers` ‚Üí Show all customers
   * `/customers/add` ‚Üí Add a new customer
   * `/customers/edit/:id` ‚Üí Edit customer

---

#### (c) Implement CRUD

1. **Read (List Customers)**

   * Fetch customers from mockapi and display in a table.
   * Show columns: **ID, Name, Email, Age, Actions (Edit/Delete)**.

2. **Create (Add Customer)**

   * A form with fields: **Name, Email, Age**.
   * On submit, call `POST /customers` and then navigate back to `/customers`.

3. **Update (Edit Customer)**

   * Load customer data into form using `GET /customers/:id`.
   * On submit, call `PUT /customers/:id`.

4. **Delete (Remove Customer)**

   * Add a "Delete" button in the list.
   * On click, call `DELETE /customers/:id` and refresh the list.
