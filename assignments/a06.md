# 📝 Assignment 06 – Passing Props to Child Component

### 🎯 **Objective**

Build a small React app that displays a list of products. Use a `ProductCard` component to display individual product details, with data passed using **props** from the `ProductList` component.

---

### 📦 **Requirements**

1. Create two React components:

   * `ProductList`: contains an array of product objects and renders a list of `ProductCard` components.
   * `ProductCard`: accepts props and displays product details in a card layout using Bootstrap or simple HTML.

2. Each product should contain the following properties:

   * `title`: Name of the product
   * `price`: Price of the product
   * `description`: Short description

3. Use Bootstrap `Card` or your own styles to make the product look visually appealing.

4. Use **props** to pass data from `ProductList` → `ProductCard`.

### 🧾 Sample Product Data

```ts
const products = [
  {
    title: "Laptop",
    price: 55000,
    description: "A powerful machine for professionals.",
  },
  {
    title: "Smartphone",
    price: 25000,
    description: "A sleek and modern smartphone.",
  },
  {
    title: "Headphones",
    price: 3000,
    description: "Noise-cancelling over-ear headphones.",
  },
];
```

### 🔧 Suggested File Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ProductList.tsx
│   └── ProductCard.tsx
└── App.tsx
```

---

### 📘 Learning Outcomes

* Understand how to define and use **props** in React
* Organize UI into **reusable components**
* Practice rendering lists using `.map()`

---

### ✅ Bonus (Optional)

* Add a `button` on each `ProductCard` (e.g., "Add to Cart")
* Style the card using Bootstrap’s grid or flex layout
