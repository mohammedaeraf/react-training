## 🧑‍💻 Assignment 04 – Using **Props** to Display Data

### 🎯 **Objective**:

Learn how to **pass and use props** in React components by creating a reusable `EmployeeCard` component that displays individual employee information using props.

---

### 📌 **Part A: Create `EmployeeCard` Component**

1. Create a component called `EmployeeCard.tsx` (or `.jsx`).

2. The component should receive the following **props**:

   * `name` (string)
   * `designation` (string)
   * `department` (string)
   * `salary` (number)

3. Display the data inside a **Bootstrap-styled card** or a styled `<div>` using proper headings and labels.

---

### ✅ **Expected Output Example**:

```plaintext
-------------------------------
Name: Alice Johnson
Designation: Manager
Department: HR
Salary: ₹60000
-------------------------------
```

---

### 📌 **Part B: Use `EmployeeCard` in `App.tsx`**

1. In your main `App.tsx`, create a **list of 3–5 employee objects**.

```ts
const employees = [
  { name: "Alice", designation: "Manager", department: "HR", salary: 60000 },
  { name: "Bob", designation: "Developer", department: "IT", salary: 70000 },
  { name: "Charlie", designation: "Analyst", department: "Finance", salary: 65000 },
];
```

2. Use the `map()` function to **pass each employee's data** as props to the `EmployeeCard` component.

---

### 💡 Bonus:

* Add a prop called `highlight` (boolean). If `true`, apply a background color to highlight that card.
* Use **TypeScript** to define `EmployeeProps` interface.

---

### 📁 **Submission Instructions**:

* Files to include:

  * `EmployeeCard.tsx`
  * `App.tsx`
* Submit via GitHub repository.

---

### 🧠 Learning Outcome:

By completing this assignment, students will:

* Understand how to pass and use props
* Learn how to reuse components with different data
* Practice looping through arrays and rendering components dynamically
