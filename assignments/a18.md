# üìù Assignment 18: Creating Reusable Card Component with `props.children`

### Objective:

Learn to use **`props.children`** in React by creating a reusable **Card** component that can display different content inside it.

---

### Requirements:

1. **Create a `Card` Component**

   * Add a `Card.js` (or `Card.tsx` if using TypeScript) file.
   * The component should render a container with some basic styling (border, padding, margin, rounded corners).
   * Inside the component, render `{props.children}` so that any content passed between `<Card>...</Card>` appears inside the card.

2. **Use the `Card` Component in `App.js`**

   * Display **at least three different cards** with varying content. Examples of content:

     * A title and paragraph
     * A title, paragraph, and a button
     * An image with caption text

3. **Styling**

   * Each card should have a **border**, **padding**, and **margin**.
   * Optional: Add background color or shadow to make it visually distinct.

4. **Bonus (Optional)**

   * Make the card **responsive** using Bootstrap classes.
   * Pass a **dynamic className** as a prop to style individual cards differently.

### Example Usage:

```jsx
<Card>
  <h3>Card Title 1</h3>
  <p>This is a simple description inside Card 1.</p>
</Card>

<Card>
  <h3>Card Title 2</h3>
  <p>This card also has a button.</p>
  <button>Click Me</button>
</Card>

<Card>
  <img src="https://picsum.photos/200" alt="Random" />
  <p>Image Caption</p>
</Card>
```

---

### Deliverables:

1. `Card.js` (or `.tsx`) file containing the reusable component.
2. `App.js` demonstrating usage with at least **three cards**.
3. Optional: Styled using Bootstrap or custom CSS.

* How `props.children` works
* Creating **reusable wrapper components**
* Passing dynamic content to components
