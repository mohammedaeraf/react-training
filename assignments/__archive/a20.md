# **Assignment: Deploy Your React App on Vercel**

## **Objective**

You will deploy the React project you developed during the course (either the **Cart App** or the **Theme App**) on **Vercel**. By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:

* Build your React app for production.
* Deploy it to Vercel.
* Share the live deployed URL with others.

---

## **Instructions**

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Project**

1. Choose **one project**:

   * Cart App
   * Theme App
2. Ensure your project runs locally without errors:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

---

### **Step 2: Build Your Project**

1. Open the terminal in your project folder.
2. Run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. Verify that a **`dist`** folder is created inside your project directory.

---

### **Step 3: Push Project to GitHub**

1. Create a new repository on **GitHub**.
2. Push your project code:

   ```bash
   git init
   git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - React App"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

### **Step 4: Deploy on Vercel**

1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and sign in with your **GitHub account**.
2. Click **New Project** → Import your React project from GitHub.
3. Keep the settings as default (Vercel auto-detects React).
4. Click **Deploy**.

---

### **Step 5: Share Deployed App**

1. Once deployment completes, you will get a **public URL** (example: `https://cart-app.vercel.app/`).
2. Test the URL in your browser.
3. Submit the URL along with your **GitHub repository link** as part of your assignment.

## **Deliverables**

* **Live Vercel Deployment URL** of your app.
* **GitHub Repository Link** containing your project code.
