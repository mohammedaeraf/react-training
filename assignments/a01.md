## 🧑‍🏫 **Assignment 01: Display Products using React & Bootstrap**

### 🎯 Objective:

Practice rendering lists in React using static arrays and Bootstrap List Groups. Learn how to use `map()` to iterate over arrays and display simple and structured data.

---

### ✅ **Part A – Display Simple Product List**

**Instructions:**

1. Create a component called `ProductListA.tsx`.

2. Inside the component, define a static array:

```ts
let products = [
  "Smartphone",
  "Laptop",
  "Wireless Headphones",
  "Smartwatch",
  "Bluetooth Speaker",
  "Gaming Console",
];
```

3. Use the `map()` function to loop through the array and display each product in a Bootstrap List Group (`<ul className="list-group">`).

4. Add a heading:
   📌 _“Available Products”_ (styled with `text-success`)

5. Import and use this component in `App.tsx`.

---

### 💡 Output Example:

```
Available Products
------------------
• Smartphone
• Laptop
• Wireless Headphones
• ...
```

---

### ✅ **Part B – Display Detailed Product List**

**Instructions:**

1. Create a second component called `ProductListB.tsx`.

2. Define the following array of product objects:

```ts
let products = [
  {
    title: "Smartphone",
    price: 599,
    description: "Latest 5G smartphone with high-resolution camera.",
  },
  {
    title: "Laptop",
    price: 999,
    description: "Lightweight laptop with Intel i7 processor.",
  },
  {
    title: "Bluetooth Speaker",
    price: 49,
    description: "Portable speaker with deep bass and long battery life.",
  },
];
```

3. Use the `map()` function to display each product in a Bootstrap List Group item, showing:

   - Product Title (bold)
   - Price (styled in green or bold)
   - Description (in smaller or muted text)

4. Add a heading:
   📌 _“Product Catalog”_ (styled with `text-primary`)

---

### 💡 Suggested Structure:

```tsx
<ul className="list-group">
  <li className="list-group-item">
    <h5>Smartphone</h5>
    <p className="text-success">$599</p>
    <small className="text-muted">
      Latest 5G smartphone with high-resolution camera.
    </small>
  </li>
</ul>
```
