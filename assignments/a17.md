# 📝 Assignment: Implement Validation in Customer CRUD Application

You have already implemented CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for the **Customer** resource from `mockapi.io` with the following structure:

```ts
{
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age: number;
}
```

Now, extend the project by **adding form validation** for `Add Customer` and `Edit Customer` forms.

---

## 🎯 Tasks

1. **Validation Rules**

   * **Name**: Required. Minimum 3 characters.
   * **Email**: Required. Must be a valid email format.
   * **Age**: Required. Must be a number between 18 and 100.

2. **Error Messages**

   * Show clear error messages below each field if validation fails. Example:

     * "Name must be at least 3 characters long"
     * "Invalid email format"
     * "Age must be between 18 and 100"

3. **Form Behavior**

   * On successful validation, allow the user to:

     * Add a new Customer (via API `POST`)
     * Update existing Customer details (via API `PUT`)

4. **Styling**

   * Use **Bootstrap form classes** (`form-group`, `form-control`, `is-invalid`, etc.) for styling.
   * Display error messages in **red text** using Bootstrap’s validation feedback styles.

---

## 📌 Example Workflow

1. User opens **Add Customer** form.
2. Leaves the fields blank → Errors should appear.
3. Enters invalid email (`abc@xyz`) → Error message appears.
4. Enters all details correctly and submits.
5. On submit → Customer is added and redirected to the Customer list.

## ✅ Expected Output

* A Customer Management App with full CRUD functionality.
* Proper **validation feedback** for `Add` and `Edit` forms.
* Smooth user experience with error handling.
